# Automated CI Pipeline for a Web Application using Jenkins

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to design and implement a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using Jenkins for a modern web application. The pipeline automatically triggers whenever new code is pushed to a GitHub repository. It performs a series of automated steps including code retrieval, dependency installation, testing, building, and artifact packaging, ensuring that the application is always in a ready-to-deploy state.

The project focuses on automation, reliability, and repeatability — key principles of modern DevOps practices.

## Objectives
- Learn how to install and configure Jenkins for CI pipelines.
- Automate the build and test process of a web application.
- Integrate GitHub with Jenkins for automatic build triggers.
- Generate build artifacts and archive them for future deployment.
- Understand Jenkins pipeline concepts, credentials management, and job configuration.

## Project Components

| Component         | Description                                                                                       |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Source Code       | A simple web application hosted on GitHub. Use sample app in Node.js, Python (Flask), or Java.    |
| Version Control   | GitHub repository manages code changes and triggers Jenkins builds via webhooks.                 |
| Jenkins Server    | Core CI system that pulls code and runs pipeline stages automatically.                            |
| Testing Framework | Unit test tools like Jest (Node.js), Pytest (Python), or JUnit (Java) ensure code quality.       |
| Build Tool        | npm, Maven, or Gradle depending on the language/framework used.                                  |
| Artifact Storage  | Jenkins packages build output (.jar, .zip, .tar.gz) for future deployment.                        |

## Pipeline Workflow (Step-by-Step)

1. **Code Checkout**  
   Jenkins automatically connects to GitHub and pulls the latest code when new commits or pull requests occur.

2. **Dependency Installation**  
   Jenkins installs required dependencies using package managers like npm, pip, or Maven.

3. **Static Code Analysis (Optional)**  
   Tools like ESLint, Flake8, or Checkstyle can be added to check code quality and enforce standards.

4. **Unit Testing**  
   Jenkins runs automated tests and fails the build if any test fails, ensuring reliability.

5. **Build and Package**  
   The app is compiled or packaged (e.g., `.jar`, `.zip`, `.tar.gz`) ready for deployment.

6. **Post-Build Actions**  
   Build artifacts are archived, and notifications can be sent to developers (email or Slack).

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Jenkins
- Follow the official Jenkins installation guide for your OS:  
  https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/

### 2. Configure Jenkins
- Start Jenkins and complete the initial setup.
- Install recommended plugins, especially Git, Pipeline, and any testing-related plugins.

### 3. Create GitHub Repository
- Push your application source code and tests to a GitHub repository.
- Add your `Jenkinsfile` at the root of your repo.

### 4. Configure GitHub Webhook
- In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings > Webhooks**.
- Add a webhook pointing to your Jenkins server URL (e.g., `http://<jenkins-server>/github-webhook/`).
- Select "push" events to trigger Jenkins builds automatically.

### 5. Create Jenkins Pipeline Job
- Create a new Pipeline job in Jenkins.
- Choose "Pipeline script from SCM" and select Git.
- Provide your GitHub repo URL and branch.
- Set the script path to `Jenkinsfile`.

### 6. Run the Pipeline
- Trigger a build manually or push new code to GitHub to start the pipeline.
- Monitor pipeline stages and logs in Jenkins UI.

---

## Expected Outputs
- Successful build artifacts (e.g., `.jar`, `.zip`, or `.tar.gz`) stored in Jenkins.
- Test reports available in Jenkins.
- Notifications sent to the development team upon success/failure.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Jenkins automates the Continuous Integration process by automatically
building, testing, and packaging the application whenever code changes are pushed to GitHub. The CI
pipeline improves software quality and development speed by catching issues early and ensuring the
application is always ready for deployment. Overall, it highlights the importance of automation and reliability
in modern DevOps practices.
